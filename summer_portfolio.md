## **Abstract**

Big picture

## **Motivation & Goals**

Condensed intro

Can different conservation practices be detected in the overall LEMA?

- What types of uncertainties exist in estimating irrigation from evapotranspiration data and why are they important?
- How do estimates of irrigation from evapotranspiration data compare to field measurements of water use?
- How can conservation practices in the LEMA and non-LEMA be evaluated?

## **Data**

| Dataset | Type of Data | Years | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| OpenET | Evapotranspiration | 2016--2021 | Monthly open satellite-based estimates of ET for the SD-6 area and surroundings; 7 datasets consisting of 6 different algorithms (**eeMetric, DisALEXI, geeSEBAL, PT-JPL, SIMS, SSEBop**) + an average of all the algorithms (**Ensemble**) |
|POLARIS | Soil | N/A | 30-m probabilistic soil property data in the SD-6 area and surroundings using only 10 relevant soil properties: **silt**: silt (%), **sand**: sand (%), **clay**: clay (%), **theta_s**: saturated soil water content (m3/m3), **theta_r**: residual soil water content (m3/m3), **ksat**: saturated hydraulic conductivity (log10(cm/hr)), **lambda**: pore size distribution index (brooks corey), **hb**: bubbling pressure (brooks corey), **n**: measure of the pore size distribution (van genuchten), **alpha**: scale parameter inversely proportional to mean pore diameter (van genuchten) (log10(kPa-1)) | 
| gridMET | Meteorological | 2000-2021 | Monthly meteorological clipped to the SD-6 LEMA and surroundings | 
| AIM-HPA | Irrigation Status | 1984-2020 | Annual data for irrigation status clipped to the SD-6 area and surroundings | 
| Cropland Data Layers | Land use/Land cover | 2006-2020 | Annual crop-specific land cover data clipped to the SD-6 area and surroundings |

## **Evaluating Conservation Practices in LEMA/Non-LEMA**

### Changes in Fallowing

### Changes in Crop Type

### Changes in Irrigation Efficiency

## **Future Work**

- What other data should OpenET be coupled with so that farmers can accurately make self-governing management decisions?
- What other analyses would be useful?
