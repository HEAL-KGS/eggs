How To Set Up Jupyter Session

---

1. Since Anaconda is installed, use the search bar to look up Jupyter on your computer.
    - Jupyter will automatically open using Microsoft Edge, but the terminal for it will still be open so copy and paste the browser token into your desired browser.

2. Once you see the Jupyter server page with your home directory, navigate to the local copy of the `eggs` repo. 

3. To open an existing notebook, click on it. To create a new notebook, click “New” in the upper right corner of the page. You’ll see a dropdown list with the kernels you can use. 

4. To create a new notebook using the `eggs` environment, choose the `eggs` kernel.
