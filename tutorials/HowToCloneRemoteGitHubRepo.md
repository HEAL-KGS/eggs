How to Clone A Remote GitHub Repo
---

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the desired directory on your machine. For me, this will look like: 

```bash
cd Desktop\KGS\eggs
```

1. Get the repo link.
    1. From a browser, open the repo on GitHub, click the green Code button, and copy the link (Note that you can use the HTTPS or SSH link depending on how youâ€™ve set up git in your command line. I recommend using SSH keys.)
    2. Alternatively, you can type the link manually if you know the user and the repo name.
2. Back in the terminal, type `$ git clone` followed by the repo link from above. $ git clone git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
    1. For this project, this command will be:
    
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:HEAL-KGS/eggs.git
    ```
